        Buttons are a great way to style your site. You can find buttons on pretty much any site, and they can be designed in several
        shapes, sizes and colours. While bootstrap limits some of the creativity that goes into designing the buttons, it makes up
        for that by doing all of the work for you. All you need is a button tag with a couple of classes, and you've got yourself a
        button! Here's an exmaple of one:
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-dark">Button!</button>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        What are buttons usually used for? Pretty much whatever people want. Do you want to link someone to another page of your site?
        Want to direct them to another area of the same page they're on? Want to bring them to a whole other website? Submit a form?
        The only thing that outnumbers the uses for buttons is how many different ways you can present them. In the next column over
        I'll go over how to incorporate a bootstrap button into your site.
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        To write out a simple button using bootstrap, you can try it out like this:
        <pre><code>&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-dark&quot;&gt;Button!&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
        In this case, we used the class of "btn-dark" to style it as a dark button, to match the nav up top. Bootstrap has several
        styles and colours to choose from that you can find on their <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/buttons/" target="_blank">site</a>.
        There's also plenty more to see so have a look around!

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-3">
        Hey you know what else is cool? Spinners! You may not love them while you're forced to look at them since it's probably
        while you wait for something to load. However, implementing them into your site when you force someone else to wait for
        content is so easy, you'll have a new appreciation for them when you run into them in the future! Here are some exmaples
        of colourful spinners you can include in your site using bootstrap:
        <div class="spinner-border text-primary" role="status">
            <span class="sr-only">Primary Loading...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="spinner-border text-secondary" role="status">
            <span class="sr-only">Secondary Loading...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="spinner-border text-success" role="status">
            <span class="sr-only">Success Loading...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="spinner-border text-danger" role="status">
            <span class="sr-only">Danger Loading...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="spinner-border text-warning" role="status">
            <span class="sr-only">Warning Loading...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="spinner-border text-info" role="status">
            <span class="sr-only">Info Loading...</span>
          </div>
          <div class="spinner-border text-dark" role="status">
            <span class="sr-only">Dark Loading...</span>
          </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        As mentioned before, spinners and loading icons are typically used when it's taking some time for content to load. Now, while
        I can't say much about the technical aspect of that as I've never built any sites with so much material that it requires a
        loading time, I sure can talk about sitting around waiting for things to load. You've almost certainly seen exactly this animation
        on YouTube videos while you wait for them to buffer. Or maybe waiting on some images to load on other websites. Nobody loves
        looking at these spinners, but most of the time it's worth the wait to get to whatever content it is that you're viewing.
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        Coding for spinners is very simple. Just like with buttons, bootstrap does all the work for you! You don't even need to worry
        about animation tags! Phew!!! To match the header and the button from earlier, we'll stick with the dark theme.
        <pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;spinner-border text-dark&quot; role=&quot;status&quot;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;sr-only&quot;&gt;Loading...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
        Once again, just like buttons, bootstrap has done just about all the work for you. In this case you can also change the colour
        of the spinner using the "text-_______" class. With all other bootstrap components, the colours stick with the same naming
        conventions. You can find more info on this <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/spinners/" target="_blank">page</a>.

        And now, just for fun, let's put these two together! We can make buttons with a loading spinner on them just as easily
        as we can make each of the two components on their own. With the power of Bootstrap, anything is possible. Except for burritos,
        haven't been able to get a free burrito through this but maybe some day. I'll keep searching. Here's an example of a
        button with a loading spinner:
        <button class="btn btn-dark" type="button" disabled>
            <span class="spinner-border spinner-border-sm" role="status" aria-hidden="true"></span>
            Loading...
        </button>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        Why would you need a button to load??? Good question, glad I asked. It can be because the button itself is loading, or maybe
        you clicked the button while on a page, and rather than refreshing the whole page, the loading spinner appears on the button 
        to let you know the gears are turning, and something is in fact happening, so sit tight and don't refresh the page due to 
        impatience.
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        Coding for button spinners is soooooo easy, I promise. It's literally combining elements of the past two components. You used
        button tag along with a span. Here's the code used for the example shown earlier:
        <pre><code>&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-dark&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; disabled&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;spinner-border spinner-border-sm&quot; 
    role=&quot;status&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Loading...
&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
        Let's run through this. You have your typical button layout, but with "disabled" thrown in. This way while whatever you have
        in the process of loading, you won't be able to click on the button again, effectively resetting the whole thing and making
        yourself wait even longer. Then within the span tag you add the spinner animation again and you can throw in some text, which
        will probably be fitting as the button will have text on it before you click. It isn't something most people would want to see
        as it means they have to wait, but as a web designer using the wonderful tool that is boostrap, how cool does that looks???
