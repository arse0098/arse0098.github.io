# MTM6201 Final

Designing my own stie in XD before creating it was very new to me, as I'm usually not considering what would go into coding for it while I'm using XD to design it.

This caused a bit of trouble for me, but it also made a few things easier. I definitely consider myself to be quite creative, but I struggle with visual creativity. Designing sites and graphic design aren't things that come very naturally to me, so my site went through several versions before I was happy with it. This could get pretty frustrating for me.

That said, being the one designing it rather than trying to copy a UX file had moments that came in handy. I was able to go over how I'd want to format my HTML and how I'd want to style everything while designing it. Working with XD first allowed me to complete the first few steps before I even opened VS Code since I already not only knew what I wanted to do, but I had a pretty good idea of how I wanted to do it as well.

I decided to keep the site fairly simple as every time I tried going a little "out there" with it, it looked awful. I am also a big fan of simple, sleek looking websites, so once I found a design I actually liked, I decided to go with it because it probably would have taken another dozen designs before I liked one again.

As far as the coding itself, I considered using bootstrap for this site, but decided to stick with flexbox for the majority of the display. It's something I feel very comfortable with and wanted to stick to.

While I still find myself using Google a whole lot when doing these assignments, I definitely feel more confident with these assignments. One thing I'm very happy with is my improvement with not having uneccesary code. Both my HTML and CSS are vastly shorter and much more organized than they were at the beginning of the semester, and it's saving me a ton of time when doing these assignments. It also saves me a ton of time when sifting through everything when looking for those inevitable mistakes that are breaking my entire site!

My font choice is "Cambria Math", and the one image I used that I didn't take myself was the Algonquin College logo.
